  <h1>webpack Dev Server</h1>
</div>

Use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) with a development server that provides live reloading. This should be used for **development only**.

It uses [webpack-dev-middleware](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware) under the hood, which provides fast in-memory access to the webpack assets.

<h2 align="center">Install</h2>

```
npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
```

<h2 align="center">Usage</h2>

The easiest way to use it is with the CLI. In the directory where your `webpack.config.js` is, run:

```
node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server
```

This will start a server, listening on connections from `localhost` on port `8080`.

Now, when you change something in your assets, it should live-reload the files.

See [**the documentation**](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver) for more use cases and options.
