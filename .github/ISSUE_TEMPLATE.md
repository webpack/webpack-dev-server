### Code

<!--
  If you have a large amount of code to share which demonstrates the problem
  you're experiencing, or your webpack config is very large, please provide a link
  to your repository rather than pasting code. We'd also encourage you to use a
  Github Gist link instead of pasting code. Otherwise, please paste relevant
  short snippets below.

  For bugs, please do consider providing a link to a stripped-down, bare-bones
  repo that can reproduce the problem you're experiencing. Many times, bugs
  aren't actual bugs, but rather specific issues with loaders, plugins, or
  an environment/OS. Problems with complicated or large applications will almost
  always require this to be triaged.

```js
  // webpack.config.js

### Expected Behavior
