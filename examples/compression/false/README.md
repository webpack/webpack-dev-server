# Gzip Compression

Website gzip compression makes it possible to reduce the file size of a file
to roughly 30% of its original size before the files are sent to the browser.

It is enabled by default. To disable it set `compress` option to `false`.

## false

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  devServer: {
    compress: false,
  },
};
```

Usage via CLI:

```console
npx webpack serve --open --no-compress
```

### What should happen

1. The script should open `http://localhost:8080/`.
2. Files being sent to the browser from the `webpack` bundle should be gzipped.
3. Open the console in your browser's devtools and select the _Network_ tab.
4. Find `main.js`. The response headers should not contain `Content-Encoding: gzip`.

## Notes

Some browsers, such as Chrome, won't show the `Content-Encoding: gzip` within
the _Response Headers_. This has been documented [here](https://github.com/expressjs/compression/issues/96).

To enable `Content-Encoding` for _Response Headers_ in Chrome, you can follow
[this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47R6uv0RKCk).
