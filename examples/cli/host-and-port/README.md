# CLI: Host and Port Options

You may choose to wish to change the host and port on which `webpack-dev-server`
will run. The `host` and `port` options allow for that.

## IPv4

```console
npm run webpack-dev-server -- --open --port 5000 --host 0.0.0.0
```

## IPv6

_This also works with IPv4_

```console
npm run webpack-dev-server -- --open --port 5000 --host ::
```

## What Should Happen

1. The script should open `http://0.0.0.0:5000/` if specifying the IPv4 option,
or `http://[::]:5000/` for IPv6, in your default browser.
2. You should see the text on the page itself change to read `Success!`.
