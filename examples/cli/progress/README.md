# CLI: Progress Option

```shell
npm run webpack-dev-server -- --open
```

## What Should Happen

1. The script should open `http://localhost:8080/` in your default browser.
2. You should see the text on the page itself change to read `Success!`.
3. In `app.js` change the text and save.
4. You should see the compilation progress in the browser console.
