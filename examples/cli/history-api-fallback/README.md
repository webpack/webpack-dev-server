# CLI: History API Fallback Option

This option enables [History API Fallback](https://github.com/bripkens/connect-history-api-fallback)
support in `webpack-dev-server`, effectively asking the server to fallback to
`index.html` in the event that a requested resource cannot be found.

```shell
npm run webpack-dev-server -- --open --history-api-fallback
```

_Note: some URLs don't work by default. For example; if the url contains a dot.
Be sure to checkout the [connect-history-api-fallback](https://github.com/bripkens/connect-history-api-fallback)
options._

## What Should Happen

1. The script should open `http://0.0.0.0:8080/` in your default browser.
2. You should see text on the page that reads 'Current Path: /'.
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/foo/bar`.
4. You should see text on the page that reads 'Current Path: /foo/background'.
