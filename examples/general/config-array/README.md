# General: Webpack Config Array

This example demonstrates using a `webpack` config containing an array of configs.

```console
npm run webpack-dev-server -- --open
```

## What Should Happen

1. The script should open `http://localhost:8080/` in your default browser.
2. You should see the text on the page itself change to read `Success!`.
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/bundle2.js`
4. The browser should display a minified JavaScript bundle.
