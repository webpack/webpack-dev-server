# General: Promise-Based Webpack Config

This example demonstrates using `webpack-dev-server` with a `webpack` config that
returns a `Promise`.

```console
npx webpack serve --open-target
```

## What Should Happen

1. The script should open `http://localhost:8080/` in your default browser.
2. You should see the text on the page itself change to read `Success!`.
