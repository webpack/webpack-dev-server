### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* the `openPage` option and the `--open-page` CLI option were removed in favor `{ open: ['/my-page', '/my-other-page/'] }` for Node.js API and `--open-target [URL]` (without `[URL]` dev server will open a browser using the `host` option value) and `--open-app <browser>` for CLI

### Bug Fixes

* `/webpack-dev-server` url shows list of files ([#3101](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/3101)) ([b3374c3](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/b3374c3ec2e07e4ba41e4ef40beaff5b9da2eccc))

  * For `IE11`/`IE10` you need polyfill `fetch()` and `Promise`, example:
  
  ```js
  module.exports = {
    entry: {
      entry: [
        'whatwg-fetch', 
        'core-js/features/promise', 
        './entry.js'
      ],
    },
  };
  ```
  
  * For `IE9` you need polyfill `fetch()` and `Promise` and use `sockjs` for communications (because `WebSocket` is not supported), example:
  
  ```js
  module.exports = {
    entry: {
      entry: [
        'whatwg-fetch', 
        'core-js/features/promise', 
        './entry.js'

    devServer: {
      transportMode: 'sockjs',
    },
  };
  ```
  
  IE8 is not supported

## [4.0.0-beta.0](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/compare/v3.11.0...v4.0.0-beta.0) (2020-11-27)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* drop support `Node.js@6` and `Node.js@8`, minimum supported `Node.js` version is `Node@10`
* the `hot` option is `true` by default
* the `hotOnly` option was removed, if you need hot only mode, use `hot: 'only'` value
* the default `transportMode` is switched from `sockjs` to `ws` (IE 11 and other old browsers doesn't support WebSocket, set `sockjs` value for `transportMode` if you need supports IE 11)
* `before`, `after` and `setup` were removed in favor `onBeforeSetupMiddleware` (previously `before`) and `onAfterSetupMiddleware` options (previously `after`)
* the `clientOptions` was renamed to the `client` option
* the `key`, `cert`, `pfx`, `pfx-passphrase`, `cacert`, `ca` and `requestCert` options were moved to `https` options, please use `https.{key|cert|pfx|passphrase|requestCert|cacert|ca|requestCert}`
* the `sockHost`, `sockPath` and `sockPort` options were removed in `client` option
* the `inline` option (`iframe` live mode) was removed
* the `lazy` and `filename` options were removed
* the `features` option was removed
* the `log`, `logLevel`, `logTime`, `noInfo`, `quiet`, `reporter` and `warn` options were removed in favor of built-in webpack logger, please read [this](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/other-options/#infrastructurelogginglevel) to enable and setup logging output
* the `fs`, `index`, `mimeTypes`, `publicPath`, `serverSideRender`, and `writeToDisk` options were moved in the `dev` option (`webpack-dev-middleware` options)
* updating `webpack-dev-middleware` to v4, which includes many breaking options changes, please [read](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware/releases)
* the `stats` option was removed, please use the [`stats`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/stats/) option from `webpack.config.js`
* the `socket` option was removed
* the `contentBase`, `contentBasePublicPath`, `serveIndex`, `staticOptions`, `watchContentBase`, `watchOptions` were removed in favor of the `static` option
* the `disableHostCheck` and `allowedHosts` options were removed in favor of the `firewall` option
* `server.listen()` will find free port if the `port` is not set and the `port` argument is not passed, also print a warning if the `port` option and the `port` argument passed to `server.listen()` are different
* the `progress` option is moved to the `client` option, set `client: {progress: true}`
* the `profile` option was removed, to print profile data, set `client: { progress: 'profile' }`
* client uses the port of the current location (`location.port`, equivalent to `sockPort: 'location'`), by default. To get previously behavior, set the `client.port` with the port you'd like to set
* client uses the hostname of the current location (`location.hostname`), by default. To get previously behavior, set the `client.host` with the hostname you'd like to set

### Features

* compatibility with `webpack@5`
* compatibility with `webpack-cli@4`
* added the `setupExitSignals` option, it takes a boolean and if true (default on CLI), the server will close and exit the process on SIGINT and SIGTERM
* update `chokidar` to v3

### Notes

Unfortunately, due to the huge amount of changes it is very difficult to display all changes in a convenient form. Therefore, we offer you a couple of popular examples (feel free to send a PR with more examples).

#### `static`

Previously `contentBase`, `contentBasePublicPath`, `serveIndex`, `staticOptions`, `watchContentBase` and `watchOptions`

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  devServer: {
    // Can be:
    // static: path.resolve(__dirname, 'static')
    // static: false
    static: [
      // Simple example
      path.resolve(__dirname, 'static'),
      // Complex example
      {
        directory: path.resolve(__dirname, 'static'),
        staticOptions: {},
        // Don't be confused with `dev.publicPath`, it is `publicPath` for static directory
        // Can be:
        // publicPath: ['/static-public-path-one/', '/static-public-path-two/'],
        publicPath: '/static-public-path/',
        // Can be:
        // serveIndex: {} (options for the `serveIndex` option you can find https://github.com/expressjs/serve-index)
        serveIndex: true,
        // Can be:
        // watch: {} (options for the `watch` option you can find https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar)
        watch: true,
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

#### `publicPath`

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  devServer: {
    dev: {
      publicPath: '/publicPathForDevServe',
    },
  },
};
```

#### `firewall`

Previously `disableHostCheck` and `allowedHosts`

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  devServer: {
    // Can be
    // firewall: ['192.168.0.1', 'domain.com']
    firewall: false,
  },
};
```

#### logging

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  infrastructureLogging: {
    // Only warnings and errors
    // level: 'none' disable logging
    // Please read https://webpack.js.org/configuration/other-options/#infrastructurelogginglevel
    level: 'warn',
  },
};
```
